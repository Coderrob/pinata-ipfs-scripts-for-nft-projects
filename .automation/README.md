# Automation Playbook

This folder centralises the engineering playbooks that define how we build and evolve the Pinata IPFS scripts. Treat the guidance here as the source of truth for day-to-day decisions and for long-term architectural planning.

## Document Map

- `code-quality-standards.md` ? canonical coding principles, naming rules, and documentation expectations.
- `refactoring-patterns.md` ? actionable catalogue of refactorings and design patterns to apply when evolving the codebase.
- `quality-checklist.md` ? pre-merge and pre-release verification steps to keep regressions out.

> Keep this folder version-controlled. Update the guidance whenever we adopt new practices or tooling so the instructions stay trustworthy.
